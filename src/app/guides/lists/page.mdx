# Lists

Lists help structure information clearly in technical writing.

## Ordered list

Use ordered lists when the sequence of items matters, such as step-by-step instructions.

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`
1. Build the project with `npm run build`
1. Deploy the build folder to the server

## Unordered list

Use unordered lists for related items without a specific order, such as software features.

- Integration with third-party APIs.
- Automated backup and recovery.
- Multi-language support.

## Nested list

The Tailwind CSS Typography [example](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/blob/fa5beecbc8b050ffd3b5263fcb66c275ebad01cc/demo/components/MarkdownSample.mdx#what-about-nested-lists) notes that "nested lists are rarely a good idea." This suggests that we might not need to sacrifice readability by using nested lists to indicate hierarchy.
