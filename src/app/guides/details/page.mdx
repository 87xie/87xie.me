# Details

`<Details>` is a closed component that simplifies the use of `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements in MDX.

It is suitable for optional or supplementary information but should not be used for critical content that all users need to see.

## Usage

To use `<Details>`, pass the `summary` and `open` props as shown below:

````mdx
<Details summary="Why is my Node.js application crashing?">
There are several common reasons for a Node.js application crash:

1. **Uncaught Exceptions:** Use a try-catch block or a process-level error handler.
2. **Memory Leaks:** Monitor memory usage with tools like `heapdump`.
3. **Dependency Issues:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible by running `npm audit`.

For detailed debugging, check the logs or use a debugger like `node --inspect`.
</Details>

<Details summary="POST /users" open>
Creates a new user:

- **Parameters:** `name` (string, required), `email` (string, required)
- **Response:** `201 Created` with JSON of new user

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}' https://api.example.com/v1/users
```
</Details>
